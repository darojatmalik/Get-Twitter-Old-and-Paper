# Get Twitter Old with Python

```
In this code, you can crawl old (1 or 2 or 3 years ago) data twitter with geolocation properties. 
You can enter query or hashtag in browser.get.

Please update your python with selenium, and use chromedriver. Before that make sure you registered
in https://apps.twitter.com/ to get API(key and secret) and Token(Key and Secret).

There is my final draft study in this file.

If you want to crawl with data twitter 7 days old, you can use https://tags.hawksey.info/.
